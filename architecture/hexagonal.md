# Hexagonal Architecture

Hexagonal architecture is an architecture model that allows designing software applications around domain logic to isolate it from external factors. The DDD principles can be translated into an architectural design, becoming an excellent approach for microservices

Hexagonal architecture is an architectural pattern for building software systems that are testable, decoupled, flexible, and maintainable. Hexagonal architecture is a pattern that helps you shift the main focus to the business domain while spending less time on the technical aspects of it.

OSF is designed to follow the [Hexagonal Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_architecture_(software)) pattern. This pattern is also known as the [Ports and Adapters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_architecture_(software)#Ports_and_adapters) pattern.
