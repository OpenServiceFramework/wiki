# OpenServiceFramework (OSF)

## What is OSF?

OSF is a framework for building microservices. It is designed to be a lightweight, flexible, and extensible framework that can be used to build a wide variety of microservices. OSF is designed to be used in conjunction with [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Istio](https://istio.io/), and [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/).

## Why OSF?

OSF is created to address the following problems:

- **Lack of a single framework for building microservices** - There are many frameworks for building microservices, but none of them cover all or majority of the needs to build microservices. This makes it difficult to build a microservice ecosystem that is consistent and easy to use.
